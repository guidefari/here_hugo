# TIL: Different types of documentation

I first came across this a few years ago, and just bookmarked the tab, and promised myself to come back and make note of it, as I found the concept useful at the time.

[Divio Documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)

The main thesis is that documentation falls into 4 quadrants

- How to
- Tutorial
- Reference
- And explanation

As defined by the website
