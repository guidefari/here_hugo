- [Max Böck (mxb.dev)](https://mxb.dev/)
- [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/) - no fluff, straight to the point. Overwhelming big wall of text, but I love it! not the easiest to navigate content, but a cool place to hangout nonetheless. You can `Tab` through the content, that way you get the links highlighted
- [jmalvarez's site](https://www.jmalvarez.dev/)
- [I'm Jack McDade and I'm tired of boring websites.](https://www.jackmcdade.com/) - love the monospace font here, code-saver.
- [monobooth](https://moonbooth.com/hugo/) - love the colors, and typography here
- [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/)
- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/)
- [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/) - very very cool blog! Jamie is an advocate for an independent web, he's put together a very cool site. [repo](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/jvt.me)

- [goosebumps.fm](https://www.goosebumps.fm/curated/inspo) - a collection of some music related sites I love.
- [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/) - this dude is a great storyteller
- [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) has rabbit-hole worthy [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). His site has been a recommended read countless times at this point, and for good reason. [Here are some key takeaways from his site](/andy). [Big thanks to Brie for the recommendation](https://twitter.com/zebriez/status/1657056237979324416?s=20)

# Reflections
- A common theme here is that I seem to enjoy good typography
- Sites that are primarily used as a second brain also resonate quite deep
