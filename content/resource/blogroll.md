- [Max BÃ¶ck (mxb.dev)](https://mxb.dev/)
- [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/) - no fluff, straight to the point. Overwhelming big wall of text, but I love it! not the easiest to navigate content, but a cool place to hangout nonetheless. You can `Tab` through the content, that way you get the links highlighted

- [I'm Jack McDade and I'm tired of boring websites.](https://www.jackmcdade.com/) - love the monospace font here, code-saver.

# Reflections
- A common theme here is that I seem to enjoy good typography
- Sites that are primarily used as a second brain also resonate quite deep
