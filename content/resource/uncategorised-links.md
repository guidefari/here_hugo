  - has a sample email that can be used to contact hosts before you commit to a place.
  - has good list of bare minimums to look out for when looking for a place, and they're pretty reasonable asks.
> - I want an entire place to myself — shared rooms are for very short stays only
> - The wifi needs to be fast and reliable — without it, I can’t work
> - The bed needs to be comfortable and at least queen-sized
> - Temperature control for the room is essential — I can’t sleep when I’m too hot or cold
> - The location needs to be within walking distance of both good restaurants and coffee shops with wifi
> - Having a washing machine in the unit is ideal since I only have 5 days’ worth of clothing (in a pinch, I can do without this)
