# intro
The idea of a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page was introduced to me by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). There's many lovely [examples](https://nownownow.com/) on the web of how these pages look.

> Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

# Daily
- Software Engineering for [Zulzi](https://zulzi.com/)
  - Currently working on Checkers' [Sixty60](https://www.sixty60.co.za/about-sixty60.html) mobile team. Mostly React Native work

## Topics I'm currently obsessed with 
- [Architecture](/tags/architecture) - recently [AWS certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/9342a916-83b2-489e-969a-aa43af8a0c77) 😄. [Related notes here](/tags/aws)
- [UX](/tags/ux)
- [How teams build & deliver software](/tags/process)
- [Product development](/tags/product) - a natural extension of the [devops](/tags/devops) topic tbh
  - [Team Topologies]({{<ref team-topologies>}})
- [Writing](/tags/writing) - Trying to keep my friends
accountable to their writing goals.
Coupled with setting up customised plans to help you write more!

# curating music
A crucial part of my daily life, I have been actively [curating](/tags/curated) music since almost as far back as memory can take me.

The process is both systemic & free-flowing, and it's so much fun for me! Crate digging in blog posts, DJ mixes, algorithms, rabbit-holes at 2AM on a Sunday morning, **lots** of recommendations from friends (this is the source of the highest quality music)

- Recording and uploading [DJ mixes]({{<ref mix>}}) ~~every other Sunday, at sunset~~.
- Building & writing music content on [goosebumps.fm](https://goosebumps.fm)
