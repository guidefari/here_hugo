## Housekeeping
- The authors: [Chris Riccomini](https://cnr.sh/) & [Dmitriy Ryaboy](https://www.amazon.com/Missing-README-Guide-Software-Engineer/dp/1718501838)
- [Amazon link to the book](https://www.amazon.com/Missing-README-Guide-Software-Engineer/dp/1718501838)

## How I found this book
The YouTube algorithm delivered the [Software Misadventures Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@softwaremisadventures),
and it was easily one of my favourite pods of 2024. High quality interviews, good dose of dry humour, and lots of lessons in there.

A few episodes I enjoyed, in no particular order:
- [Early Twitter's fail-whale wars | Dmitriy Ryaboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzb7Gtu2a8) - This is the episode with one of the authors of the book.
- The [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/) episodes were real cool.
  - [Build the scary stuff | Bryan Cantrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFD2bq1_tU&t=4137s)
  - [Uncrating the Oxide Rack | Bryan Cantrill, Steve Tuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_XqNYt0cY0)
- [Growing and selling an indie business | Michael Lynch - TinyPilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_SZ59GM9s) - I really like [Michael Lynchâ€™s website](https://mtlynch.io/). Iâ€™ve spent countless hours on there and I reference his writing a fair amount.
- [Breaking distributed systems for fun and profit | Kyle Kingsbury - Jepsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdfZxN-IkpA&t=4441s)

Anyway, onto what weâ€™re here for - book notes.

## Whoâ€™s this for?
The book is aimed at new software engineers, and aims to share the practical aspects of software engineering that arenâ€™t taught in computer science curricula. Or as the authors say:
> The Missing README is the book we wish we had when we started out

## On Stickiness & rewriting
They quote [Ben Horowitz - The hard thing about hard things](https://www.amazon.co.za/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)

> The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product thatâ€™s at least ten times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter.

Then go on to say 
> the same idea applies to existing code. If you want to rewrite code or diverge from standards, your improvement must be **an order of magnitude better**. Small gains arenâ€™t enoughâ€”the cost is too high. Most engineers underestimate the value of convention and overestimate the value of ignoring it.

Iâ€™ve heard Will Larson say something similar [RE migrations](/migrations). Itâ€™s only valuable to engage in a migration if you have 10x more users, or 10x more engineers than when the software was first written.

## Use Boring Technology
This one is about managing [cognitive load](/clt).

> All technology is going to break, but old stuff breaks in predictable ways. New things break in surprising ways.

- [Dan McKinley - Choose boring technology](https://boringtechnology.club/)

## Donâ€™t go rogue
> Donâ€™t ignore your companyâ€™s (or industryâ€™s) standards because you donâ€™t like them. 
> Your preferences might truly be better. Going rogue still isnâ€™t a good idea. In the short term, do what everyone else is doing. 

Similar to using boring technology to keep cognitive load low, follow convention. If you feel things really need to change, start a conversation, go through the established channels, discuss trade-offs and pragmatic approaches. Itâ€™s a team sport at the end of the day.

## Consider rewrites a last resort
> Rewrites should only be undertaken if the benefit exceeds the cost; they are risky, and their cost is high. **Engineers always underestimate how long a rewrite will take.**

Iâ€™m guilty of that last sentence. ðŸ’€

## Throw early, catch late
- Throw exceptions as close to the error as possible
- Propagate exceptions up the call stack until you reach the level of the program that's capable of handling the exception

## Retry intelligently
Exponential backoff (`(retry number)^2`) is good to a certain point. In a distributed system scenario, if all clients experience a blip at the same time, then use the same backoff strategy to retry, they'll issue requests at the same time.

This results in a **thundering herd**! To handle this, add *jitter* - the client adds a random, bounded amount of time to the backoff. This adds an element of randomness, thus reducing th likelihood of a stampede.

Not everything is supposed to be retried, sometimes it's best to let the software crash and let a human trigger the retry. e.g. when writing data, executing some business process, or something with side-effects.


## Evolving APIâ€™s
- Forward compatibility & backward compatibility 

- Note on protobuffs and `required`
> Remember, `required` is forever
