# POSSE
I’m an advocate for owning your content, and publishing on your own platform. There’s a term for that - POSSE.

> ***POSSE*** is an abbreviation for **Publish (on your) Own Site, [Syndicate](https://indieweb.org/Category:syndication) Elsewhere**, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like [social media](https://indieweb.org/social_media) silos) with [original post links](https://indieweb.org/original_post_link) to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content. - [source - https://indieweb.org/POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)

# Async operations in distributed systems

[A video from SST goes into how to handle this with AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PJM7mtF-eo)
- The simplest way to handle this is `API + Lambda` worker (Endpoint + Compute)
- Similar, but more robust is `API + Queue + Lambda` (Endpoint + Message queue + Compute)

*The compute layer isn’t just limited to Lambda/serverless - you can also [spinning up fargate](https://youtu.be/3PJM7mtF-eo?si=T3DfOtyn7WriVCAx&t=572) containers as and when needed, or just rely on your own dedicated servers.*

The general idea is a client facing API gateway receives job requests, and immediately [responds to the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202), then begins processing in the background.

Introducing a message queue really ups the game on robustness. It brings in the following capabilities, and more:
- Built-in retry mechanisms
- Ensures job is not lost if the worker fails. If the worker crashes, message remains in queue
- Load balancing - buffers incoming jobs during high traffic

Good old cron jobs are useful for workflows that don’t need you to trigger processing via an endpoint. I like to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for these. Your cloud provider will likely have many options for setting up cron jobs.

# Marketplace Dynamics
Recent conversations about marketplace products have prompted me to revisit [my notes on network effects](https://www.guidefari.com/network-effects/). 

In summary, it’s 
> When a product gets more valuable to its users as a result of acquiring more users

Network effects have a big influence on the success or failure of a marketplace product.
 
> [Based on whether you are pursuing a global or local network effect, you can usually either constrain the audience by category or geography to start: Grubhub started in one neighborhood in Chicago, for example. Amazon started with just books.](https://caseyaccidental.com/product-market-fit-network-effects/)
