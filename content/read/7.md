## SQL for noobs

I've been on a mission to migrate local MDX content to a Postgres, and I have basically zero SQL experience.

# Joins

## Left join

# Foreign keys & composite keys

## JSON builder array

# Behind the scenes: seeding goosebumps db
For context, goosebumps content has always been locally served MDX files.
With the infra migration, I knew I needed to move content to the server.
First task though, was to figure out how to render content sourced from the server, and not at build time.

So I moved the content to S3 and served it using lambda functions, and got the rendering bit sorted out.

Now it's time for the content to actually live in a db, and not S3ðŸ˜„

- Everytime I seed, I'm resetting the table like so:
```sql
		sql.raw(`TRUNCATE TABLE ${getTableName(table)} RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`),
```
