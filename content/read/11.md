Yo! Welcome to another reading list 🖖🏽

## Stuff I wrote
- Quality of life item for mac users with touch ID - [here's how you can use your fingerprint instead of typing in your password when sudo prompt for it.](https://www.guidefari.com/bio-sudo/)

## Blogs
- A bit of a spicy, but thought provoking one - [AI is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers)
- [Logging Best Practices: 12 Dos and Don'ts](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/logging-best-practices/#12-don-t-rely-on-logs-for-monitoring) - This is a 2 in 1, blog post accompanied by a youtube video. Good for brushing up on logging basics for production.
- I've got two picks from the [Stay SaaSy blog](https://staysaasy.com/). 
  - First is a piece on [ways you're eroding accountability](https://staysaasy.com/management/2025/01/29/ways-youre-eroding-accountability.html). 
  - The second goes into [why it's probably a bad idea to replace your productivity SaaS tools with internally baked software](https://staysaasy.com/management/2024/09/15/replacing-tools.html).
- [Forest And Desert](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ForestAndDesert.html) - Simple idea discussed here, but eye opening. It reminded me to consider my own blindspots, as well as others' whenever I make suggestions that feel very intuitive to me.
- [Paying down tech debt: further learnings](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/paying-down-tech-debt-further-learnings/) - The author of this post is writing a whole book on the topic, titled **Swimming in Tech Debt**.

To close off this section, here's an excerpt from my book notes from [The Missing ReadMe](https://www.amazon.com/Missing-README-Guide-Software-Engineer/dp/1718501838)

> [Exponential backoff (`(retry number)^2`) is good to a certain point. In a distributed system scenario, if all clients experience a blip at the same time then use the same backoff strategy to retry, they'll issue requests at the same time. This results in a **thundering herd**! To handle this, add *jitter* - the client adds a random, bounded amount of time to the backoff. This adds an element of randomness, thus reducing the likelihood of a stampede.]([guidefari.com/missing-readme](https://guidefari.com/missing-readme#retry-intelligently))

> [Not everything is supposed to be retried, sometimes it's best to let the software crash and let a human trigger the retry. e.g. when writing data, executing some business process, or something with side-effects.](https://guidefari.com/missing-readme#retry-intelligently)

## Podcasts
- The author of Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures on [goto; book club](https://gotopia.tech/episodes/335/building-multi-tenant-saas-architectures).
