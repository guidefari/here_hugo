# Tips & Tricks from Scott Chacon

## Setting up an alias

`git config --global alias.staash 'stash --all'`

- Now when I type `git staash`, this is executed `git stash --all`
- fyi, `git stash --all` will also stash untracked files. This is more intuitive I think.

## Simpler way to separate git configs for groups of repos

You need to add this to the global git config.

```
[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/oss"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-oss

[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/work"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work

```

## `git branch` sorts branch alphabetically
And that's not very helpful. You can sort by most recently committed

`git config --global branch.sort -committerdate`

## How to avoid overwriting someone's work with a force push
`git config --global alias.fpush 'push --force-with-lease'`

> Git will first check if the branch you are force pushing to matches the expected state at the time your local branch was last fetched or pulled.
