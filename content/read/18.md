## [Every Single Human. Like. Always.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/every-single-human-like-always/)

Michael Lopp shares some experiences he’s had with using the robots to build stuff from prompts. AI’s make assumptions, forget, and make errors, just like humans. Meaning the burden is on us to be specific, validate outputs, provide context, and plan. A pretty different skillset from focus on purely writing code, and getting better at this will improve your communication with the robots, and humans alike!

> the assumption most folks have is that hallucinations are bad. Incorrect, it’s the hallucinations that you catch that are obviously wrong that you dislike. When the robots hallucinate a helpful thing, you don’t complain.

## [~~Data~~ Dollar Driven](https://justingarrison.com/blog/2025-07-23-dollar-driven/)
> the only data that actually matters is money.
> Every other data you collect, visualize, and optimize is a proxy for money.

Software engineers are usually kept far away from the money. In this post, Justin Garrison explains why that’s an anti-pattern.

## [Disposable Code Is Here to Stay, but Durable Code Is What Runs the World](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/disposable-code-is-here-to-stay)
Charity Majors distinguishes between disposable and durable code. The implications discussed touch on economics, risk, maintenance, and the talent and labor market (encompassing skills, roles, and pay scales).

Disposable code is the quick, low-stakes stuff you generate to explore, prototype, or accomplish a one-off task and then discard; durable code is the rigorously maintained, observable, and incrementally evolved software you must trust in production because failures have material, systemic consequences.

> If I had to guess, I suspect it won’t be a profession at all so much as a skill set, much like typing or spreadsheets, that any tech-literate modern worker is expected to pick up in order to perform the functions of their job in marketing, sales, product, design, etc.

> disposable software is a skill set; durable code is a profession.

Perhaps related to this article, is something I overheard (or read?) this week:
> Vibe coding is the new low-code/no-code

## [UX note: persisting ui state in browser history state](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating?ck_subscriber_id=1998026647)
I was reading through NextJS docs, and something I haven’t implemented yet but know will be handy.

> Next.js allows you to use the native window.history.pushState and window.history.replaceState methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

```tsx
'use client'
 
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'
 
export default function SortProducts() {
const searchParams = useSearchParams()
 
function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
params.set('sort', sortOrder)
window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }
 
return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## [The lifecycle of technical committees and how they inevitably collapse](https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/technical-committee-lifecycle)
My takeaway from this - disband a committee after the original goal is achieved. 

## Random notes
I love it when I bump into a corner of the web that has ✨personality✨
[livelaugh.blog](https://livelaugh.blog/posts/1) is one such site. I love the font, colors, layout and how it all comes together. The feeling here is "welcome to my world".

Such experiences make me think of [Derek Sivers' *Touch as many of their senses as you can*](https://sive.rs/senses)

I can think of a few other websites that evoke this feeling:
- [I'm Jack McDade and I'm tired of boring websites.](https://jackmcdade.com/)
- [musicForProgramming](https://musicforprogramming.net/), which also happens to be made by one of my all time favourite musician.
- [localghost.dev](https://localghost.dev/)

Until next time, ciao!
