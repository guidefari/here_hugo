# Reading list 

* [Be A Property Owner And Not A Renter On The Internet](https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/) - Bit of a long read, I’m still going through it. I’m a big fan of anything that advocates for [independence on the web](https://indieweb.org/).
  * Related - [My note on digital gardens](https://www.guidefari.com/digital-garden/).
* [Testing My Static Site with Vitest](https://randomgeekery.org/post/2025/01/testing-my-static-site-with-vitest/) - Astro blog, 500+ posts. Makes sense to start introducing tests at this point. After breaking my RSS feed enough times, I wrote a test for it.
