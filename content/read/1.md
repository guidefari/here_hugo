## Context

I go through lots of tech content: articles, podcasts, books, videos. As a result, I often find myself sharing the same groups of links with my mates & colleagues, all over different chat apps.

This is a consolidation effort.

## Books on my shelf

- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/). Been a big fan of [Will’s blog](https://lethain.com/) for a while now. This book’s my current active read, I’ve been wanting to read his books for a while. [This summary](https://refactoring.fm/p/an-elegant-puzzle?r=n4azl&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) gave me the final nudge to start the book.
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/). I watched a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaLSwhciSfs) not too long ago, that I felt was a great summary of the book. Left me wanting to dig in
