## Current Philosophy on writing

[Writers who operate by Will Larson](https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate/) helped me solidify the **why** behind my writing. I expand on it [here](https://www.guidefari.com/audience-of-one/). Since then, I’ve been writing a whole lot more in Apple notes, but my publishing rate hasn’t changed. I’m ok with this balance, for now.
