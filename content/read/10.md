Citizens of the internet, greetings! 🖖🏽

## Stuff I wrote
- I recently went through a platform migration on goosebumps.fm, and boy was that a journey. [Here are some retro notes](https://www.guidefari.com/gbfm-migration/).

Borrowing from [The Missing Readme](https://www.guidefari.com/missing-readme/):

> [If you want to rewrite code or diverge from standards, your improvement must be an order of magnitude better. Small gains aren’t enough—the cost is too high. Most engineers underestimate the value of convention and overestimate the value of ignoring it.](https://www.guidefari.com/missing-readme/)

- [Will Larson on migrations](/migrations)

## Podcasts

Got a handful of episodes to share this week.

- [Corey Quinn and Gitpod CTO in conversation about standardised remote dev environment](https://share.transistor.fm/s/cd30c9b5)
- [Very closely related is Dax showing his remote dev setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ2gz5i7VAA)
- [Jon Cutler on surviving organisational politics](https://nononsenseagile.podbean.com/e/nn-0114-surviving-organisational-politics-with-john-cutler/) 
- [Soft Skills Engineering is a weekly advice podcast for software developers.](https://softskills.audio/) - This is one of the shows I listen to on a regular. They’re 400+ episodes in - so have a scroll, find a title that resonates, and dig in🙌🏽
- Always a good vibe to hear from [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/) & [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/about). What stuck out from [Episode 647](https://shoptalkshow.com/647/) for me was [Slash pages vs wikis vs blog posts](https://shoptalkshow.com/647/#t=06:52).

## Videos

- [Matt Pocock goes over Vercel’s AI SDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mojZpktAiYQ&t=763s). Solid intro to the topic
  - [Scott Moss via frontendmasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/openai-node/) does deeper dives into building AI powered apps. Tap in
- [Tailwind v4 is stable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud913ekwAOQ&t=492s)! - biggest change being the CSS first config

## Blogs

- [Will Larson - Friction isn’t Velocity](https://lethain.com/friction-vs-velocity/). Found and read this one while writing this week’s newsletter. That’s one thing I enjoy about writing, it naturally leads to more reading
- [Stay SaaSy - Management Mantras](https://staysaasy.com/saas/2025/01/24/management-mantras.html)
- [Webpage annoyances I don’t inflict on you here](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/01/04/cruft/?__readwiseLocation=) - Love it when I bump into an old school  blog like this. You can tell this is done for the love of the game, not much else.

As I said 7 months ago:
> [If you're trying to get shit done, choose boring stuff](https://guidefari.com/ci-cd)
- [Choose boring technology by Dan McKinley](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)- This one’s also on my reading list, would be nice to get to it this week.
