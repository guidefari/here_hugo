## [Thereâ€™s YouTube downloader at home](/ytdl)
I occasionally download music and mixes from YouTube for archiving purposes, and always forget the website I use for the downloads. I just type `yt` and hope for the best, hope like hell that the website Iâ€™m looking for is in my browser history. Itâ€™s not always in the history 

I couldnâ€™t find a `cli` tool that I like. I then decided itâ€™d be a good idea to sit down for an afternoon and create a YouTube downloader. After all, this is a project Iâ€™d been wanting to work on for a long time, just for the sake of it, just to see how Iâ€™d do it.

Long story short, I spent more than just an afternoon on it ðŸ˜‚ I learnt some stuff along the way, got to use [SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html) hands on for the first time, found approaches to how to put together async jobs in serverless AWS.

## Podcast corner
My favourite genre of podcast is two friends hanging out, and chatting about tech adjacent topics. Sometimes completely unrelated conversations come up, and thatâ€™s the magic. These kinds of podcasts arenâ€™t here to â€™teach you about these 5 topics in linear fashionâ€™, itâ€™s more free flowing conversation.

That said, hereâ€™s a few picks Iâ€™d recommend:
- [Tomorrow.fm](https://tomorrow.fm/): This one's great for keeping up with open source JS things.
- [Soft Skills Engineering podcast](https://softskills.audio/): Lots of wisdom and jokes in this one.
- [Mostly technical](https://mostlytechnical.com/): I recently started listening to this, I don't remember what prompted me to, but I'm glad I did.
- [Shop Talk](https://shoptalkshow.com/): I don't always listen to this, but it's always a great time when I commit to an episode.
- [Whiskey, Web and Whatnot](https://whiskey.fm/): Two friends that love whiskey invite a guest, send them a bottle of whiskey, have a tasting session and then start chatting tech.
