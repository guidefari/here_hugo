# Sharpening your design chops

I read these books as a freshman frontender, and I think they laid a solid foundation. I still cite lessons from them. Would recommendðŸ«¡

- Book: [Donâ€™t make me think](https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/)
- Book: [The design of everyday things](https://www.amazon.co.za/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654)
- Book: [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) - I would say this one is the best place to start

  - [Complementary videos from Steve Schoger](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDVpvW8ghDr9tasku_YvuTy_l0xPUtOHE&si=Tgd84QVcpKNqIU_0)
