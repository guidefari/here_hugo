# Software Delivery 

#### [Eskil Steenberg ‚Äì You should finish your software ‚Äì BSC 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLoKbBn-VI)

A key takeaway from the talk is that you should be okay with never coming back to improve on code after you ship to production.

I really enjoyed this talk, made [a dedicated note for it](https://guidefari.com/finish) to capture everything that resonated.

#### [Fixed time, variable scope](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#fixed-time-variable-scope)

A take on introducing a creative constraint to the software delivery process.

#### [Shreyas Doshi - Being Overcommitted and Overallocated: the Good and the Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXynFtimpbw)

Speaks about his experience at Google where his manager would regularly overcommit him, and expect him to prioritise and drop/delegate some things. He also addresses how this is a failure mode of leadership, and insists that product leaders must clearly communicate "what matters, why it matters, and what matters less" to empower their teams.
The importance of documenting and reiterating the true priorities is also highlighted in this video.

#### [Barend Erasmus - What My URL Shortener Taught Me About Malicious Traffic](https://barenderasmus.com/posts/what-my-url-shortener-taught-me-about-malicious-traffic)

> I‚Äôd see bursts of traffic hitting random, suspicious-looking paths. Things like `/admin.php`, `/sendgrid.env`, or just plain `/env`

I remember seeing a lot of the same traffic patterns during [my self-hosting era](https://www.guidefari.com/ci-cd/).


# Career Strategy

#### [Chronos & Kairos - a framework for just-in-time consulting](https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/)

This article is somewhat of a modern classic for me. A modern guide to understanding strategic timing in professional life.
Written with consultants in mind, I find it useful for knowledge workers in general.

#### [The next next job](https://andrewchen.com/the-next-next-job/)

Something I've heard Dax speak about a few times is when you're making career decisions: try to think about the next next job, and why you can't get it right away.
Working backwards from there will have you taking more measured steps.

#### [how to be a good technical leader with Sander Hoogendoorn](https://nononsenseagile.podbean.com/e/0122-how-to-be-a-good-technical-leader-with-sander-hoogendoorn/)

draws experiences and preferences from a long lived career. Find out tactics and strategies that keep Sander's teams thriving - covering topics such as mob programming, keeping teams small,
being very intentional about the kind of company you choose to engage with, and tips on overcoming burnout.


# Tactical

#### [Using clip-path to wrap text around images](https://youtu.be/ynExo2UUFro?si=0NMTxSawpiHGtU-R)

Cool CSS trick! You can achieve that magazine/newspaper effect this way üôåüèΩ

#### [Away from exceptions - errors as values](https://humanlytyped.hashnode.dev/away-from-exceptions-errors-as-values)

For expected errors, I think it makes for easier flow control of your code to return errors instead of throwing them.
Go was really onto something with 

```go

return (val, err)

---

if (err != nil) {
    // handle error
}

```

#### [git worktree](https://youtu.be/oI631eCAQnQ?si=93Bu5QZGQfrjukQq)

- I've been using claude code, it was occasionally helpful to have separate directories for long running tasks.
