Popularised by Microsoft, the idea is simple: **At any given time, the highest priority is to eliminate bugs before writing any new code**.

## Philosophy & history (according to me ðŸ‘€)
"Stop the line" taken from Toyota's production line system is related the zero defect strategy in my opinion

> Autonomation, or its Japanese name Jidoka, means that work is organized so that the slightest abnormality is immediately detected, work stops, and the cause of the problem is remedied before work resumes. 

> [The only way to handle issues in a continuous improvement environment is to see each issue as an opportunity for improvement, and a stepping stone for sustainable growth.](https://blog.planview.com/stop-the-line-how-lean-principles-safeguard-quality/)


## More practial tips

- Automated pipelines are your friend.
  - Make sure you can build, static analysis, type checking, tests etc at each merge or pull request for your trunk branch
- My friends have also suggested pre-commit hooks. But I'm not a fan, I commit early & often, pre-commit hooks can feel like death by thousand cuts in a big codebaseðŸ˜¬
