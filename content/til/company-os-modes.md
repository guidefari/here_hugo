John Cutler hosted an AMA session to discuss ["Understanding enabling constraints using shape up"](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-386-understanding-enabling-constraints).
The topic of how communication is handled within teams/companies came up. 

Lately, I've been revisiting this topic frequently. Another source I'd recommend is [Charity Majors' interview on the Tuple youtube channel](https://youtu.be/7VUnf8VVB8w). (Expecting to publish my notes from this video soon👀)

Some more analogies to expand on the quadrants:

# Intentional + Implicit
- Apprenticeship: "We pair new people with veterans. You learn by osmosis."
- "If you don't get it after a few months, you're probably not a culture fit."
- "We talk through decisions, mostly in real time"

In my opinion, this mode works best with smaller, mature teams.

# Inentional + Explicit
- Transparent by default: "We document decisions publicly so anyone can understand the why."
- Playbooks as living documents. Encouraged for everyone to contribute to them

# Afterthought + Implicit
- "Bella is the only person who knows the how/why - go to her"

# Afterthought + Explicit
-
