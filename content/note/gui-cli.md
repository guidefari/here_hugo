## Glossary
- GUI: Graphics User interface
- CLI: Command Line interface
- TUI: Terminal User interface
  - eg [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/), [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), [terminal.shop](https://www.terminal.shop/), [vim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

I will use CLI & TUI interchangeably.

## Context
A good experience when interacting with a GUI has a few things in common with a good experience in the terminal.

The intersection is [ux](/tags/ux).

# The similarities
- Follow conventions. Your users likely have common usage patterns that their muscle memory know to look out for
  - Maintain common keyboard shortcuts
  - CLI: maintain common flags/arguments eg `man` page, or `--help` `-h`
- [Provide user feedback](https://clig.dev/#saying-just-enough) when doing stuff in the background.
- Easy discoverability
  - CLI's achieve this via comprehensive text, suggesting commands & subcommands, and providing examples of common stuff.
  - `jq` and `git` are good examples of this.
- If you're performing destructive actions, or [state changes on the machine, inform the user](https://clig.dev/#output).

- This is true for both GUI & CLI apps:
> By default, don't output to the user information that's only understandable by creators of the software.
> Catch errors & rewrite them for humans.

- UX copy is important
  - CLI: When designing commands, subcommands, flags & arguments
  - CLI: Don't use ambiguous or similarly named commands
  - [There's lots of writing on UX copy](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-writing-study-guide/) in the world of GUI apps.
