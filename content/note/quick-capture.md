Essential part of the writing process is the concept of quick capture.

The idea is to make it as frictionless as possible to capture those fleeting thoughts as they fly through my head.
And these thoughts tend to pop into my head when I'm not on my desk, so a good mobile experience is key too.

- That quick meeting note
- That project idea that pops up when you're in gym
- Ideas for improvements in the codebase or architecture

The easier it is to write, the more you'll do it. 
I've happily been using apple notes for this

## Useful properties
- Opens up at lightning speed. Sometimes you only have a few seconds to jot a thought down
- Reachable across multiple devices.
    - Cater Mobile & desktop
