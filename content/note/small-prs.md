- If a task is big enough, multiple small & focused PR's are a solid way to approach it
- A PR with 2 lines changed is ok
- If your environment allows for it, follow [ship/show/ask](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html)
- Mitigates risk by having feedback earlier in the dev process
- Helps keep reviews focused, and high quality
- Easier rollbacks and identification of issues
- Works well when combined with markdown notes next to the code

### Works well when combined with [Microsoftâ€™s zero defects](/zero-defect-strategy) methodology
> [**zero defects** meant that at any given time, the highest priority is to eliminate bugs before writing any new code](/zero-defect-strategy)

- With that said, each small PR should leave the pipelines green, with hopefully no breaking changes
