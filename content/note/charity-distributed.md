## Remote teams need more mature systems

The skill set for managing a distributed team is very different from that of an in person team (part time or full time).

- Lots can be communicated implicitly in person. Communication has to be very intentional when remote.
- Written communication at that. It’s easier to be a talking culture and get away with it when working in person.

Remote teams don't have the luxury of relying on implicit and undocumented communication. Collocated teams on the other hand, can roll this way.

> I do feel like from a company perspective a distributed company needs to grow up or mature much faster. when you're when you're all collocated together as a startup you don't need systems you know for a lot of things.

> they run an implicit or or body language you people just know things right because they're in the air, they're mentioned they're overheard

Management is arguably more important and needed earlier in distributed settings.

> There is a communication tax a management tax, meaning you need more managers and the ratio of managers to IC's is higher in a distributed companies.
> Managers serve as the connective tissue to ensure the right messages are getting communicated right people the the right places the right time

## On permeating connection, trust, culture etc

- Team culture does not evolve organically; you have to set aside time to ask people personal questions to talk about your lives to do things that are not super workrelated.
  - In my experience, spending time mob programming can remedy this.
- Building trust must be done very intentionally. If it's not "someone's job and you're paying someone to do it and it gets done or it's no one's job and either someone takes on that unpaid labor or it doesn't get done"

### RTO as "Reverting to the Last Known Good State"

- People who had existing in-person bonds before the pandemic were "fine when they dispersed," but new hires struggled to build the necessary connections in a fully remote environment

* She acknowledges that some companies implementing RTO are not necessarily acting in bad faith, but are reacting to data showing a decline in employee well-being.
* The data indicates that trust has plummeted and people's sense of connectedness to their colleagues and workplace has plummeted.
* she believes achieving a "hybrid humane" model is so difficult, especially considering the controversy around Return to Office (RTO) mandates

## On down levelling, aka stepping down

For context, Charity transitioned from being CEO of honeycomb, to CTO.

> I never wanted to be CEO i did it reluctantly. One thing I learned was that I think you really want a pretty structured person to be your CEO and I am not that and I don't want to try and be that. I'm now the most senior IC in our company and I love it I love it!

She acknowledges that stepping down, even if it is what you desire, is difficult because

> we're all just we're naked monkeys, and part of being a mammal is being sensitive to hierarchy.

This makes stepping down a lot to process whether or not it's something you want.

She views intentional down leveling as a way to prioritize self-knowledge and self-awareness, noting that

> Sometimes, we don't know what we're capable of or what we truly love or what we truly don't love until we're tested at our edges

Down levelling is a natural part of the ebs & flows of this process.

## Foster 10x teams instead of trying to hire 10x engineers!

Trying to hire for these is the wrong way.

Charity says that what you’re after is a 10x team, and the best software teams are those where a [“normal”](https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/) 1x engineer can come in and consistently push solid work, every single day.

> Every time you ship a diff, you get to learn something

I should probably make a separate note on this topic!!😬
