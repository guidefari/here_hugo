Theory
> a Bounded Context is a semantic contextual boundary. This means that within the boundary each component of the software model has a specific meaning and does specific things.

> Remember that a Bounded Context is where a [model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html) is implemented, and you will have separate software artifacts for each Bounded Context.

# In Practice
- I think this translates to having separate ubiquitous language docs. With each doc separated by the bounded context.
- Keep your artifacts (docs & diagrams) anywhere you can have multiple people work on one file, plus the ability to leave comments.
  - eg confluence, notion, google docs
- Bear your [audience](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/audience) in mind - whoâ€™s reading/maintaining these ubiquitous language docs? 
- What other bounded contexts do you have to interact with? A way to think about this is [Team Interaction Modeling with Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies)
- Event storming for domain modelling
  - miro/figma boards for domain modelling.
