## What I’ve witnessed consultants do
1. Measure/document the current state of things
2. Analyse and discuss the results with key stakeholders. These are the early stages of brainstorming, as it’s likely that what you’ve measured makes for good conversation starters. Often highlighting things that no one thought to critically look at, in the heat of day to day work.
3. Write down what the ideal state of things would look like, and your appetite for the efforts
4. Start working backwards from there

### Dan North also shares his approach

1. Visualise - Visualising involves observing and measuring the current processes, 
2. Stabilise - stabilising aims to reduce variability and establish consistency. 
3. Iteratively work towards solution - improvement and tinkering with the processes.
