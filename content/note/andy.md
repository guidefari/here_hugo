- [Tags are an ineffective association structure](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Tags_are_an_ineffective_association_structure) - interesting take. Related to [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC). I find them useful for quick grouping and navigation of my notes, especially when I want to share a bunch of notes on related topics, but don't remember everything I've written on the topic. That's just one use caseðŸ˜„

- [Close open loops](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8d4eJNaKrVDGTFpqRnQUPRkexB7K6XbcffAV) is something I've heard Tiago Forte talk about too
- If you're writing and learning in public, [you are the primary audience by default](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J). don't mix the process of writing 'publishable' work, and notes for yourself, those are two different caps. Very similar idea to Martin Fowler's workflows of refactoring.

while we're on the topic of [atomic & evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), the structure that Andy describes is similar to [how Tom Critchlow thinks about riffs](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/). The big differences seem to be the motivation, but the execution shares similar principles.
