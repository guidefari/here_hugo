[Prompted by Kyle Shevlin](https://kyleshevlin.com/ai/) this note is a living document to capture how I use AI.

# Writing
I've experimented with using AI chat to generate outlines for notes (grand total of 2 or 3 notes to date). Using AI for writing doesn't exactly give me a productivity boost, and I feel like it's in conflict of one of my guiding principles, ["writing for an audience of one"](/audience-of-one).

Theoretically, it's useful when writing podcast & book notes, cause I can ask questions about the specific points I want to capture, but again, I've only done this for like 2 notes.
For this, check out:

- [Google Notebook](https://notebooklm.google/) - useful for prompting PDF documents

I think I just prefer hand-written notes.
# Programming
This is where I make my heaviest use of AI.

- Occasionally, [v0](https://v0.dev/) for generating UI shells
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) was my main IDE for 4 months. I recently cancelled it and moved to ZED.
- Current IDE: [ZED](https://zed.dev/) + [Claude chat](https://www.anthropic.com/api). No inline autocomplete
- Claude/ChatGPT via raycast - keymapped to `opt + c`.
	- [I show more of my raycast workflow here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDlNVl4xMU).

I have mixed feelings about programming with AI inline autocomplete. While definitely a boost for productivity, there's the risk of finding oneself in an unfamiliar feeling codebase after churning out lots of features. 

Sure, stuff works, and I can read and understand how/why it works, but areas of
