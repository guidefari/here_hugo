> When a product gets more valuable to its users as a result of acquiring more users.

I'm used to hearing network effects being mentioned in the context of social networks (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc). The concept is equally relevant in marketplaces, & other kinds of SaaS platforms.

## Marketplace example
A marketplace has 2 categories of actors, providers/producers & consumers.

A few real world examples:

| **Product** | **Provider** | **Consumer** |
|---|---|---|
| Uber Eats | Restaurant | Hungry human |
| Amazon | Shop/Vendor | Buyer |
| Spotify | Artist | Fan |


## A few different types of Network Effects
1. **Direct** network effects: Every additional user makes the product better for all existing users. Most common. Social networks would fall in this category.
2. **Cross-side** network effects: Adding a user on one side of the network makes it better for users on the other side of the network. Marketplaces & SaaS' network effects fall in this category. Also known as an **Indirect Nework effect**
3. **Data** network effects: The quality of something improves as more data is collected. A good example of this is Spotify or Youtube's music recommendation algorithms.
