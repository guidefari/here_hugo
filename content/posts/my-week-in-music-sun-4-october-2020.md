I'd totally open a gig with this track, it sets such a mood for jive.

This is the track that made me think, 'hmm, maybe I should finally write that piece'. I'm glad these guys are releasing tunes somewhat more often lately.

## featuring Jonwayne
Just when I thought I'd exhausted Jonwayne's discography, I've started bumping into projects he's featured in, and he always leads to some really good producers.

'man, Aphex Twin have weird album covers sometimes' - My thoughts when I found this track. But they make good shit so whatever😂I just found out this track was released in '95 🤯

## James Blake - You're Too Precious [🔗](https://youtu.be/6WfY8wixwD8)
`experimental` `alternative pop` `indie r&b`

I'm not sure what you'll feel when you hear this, but you'll feel something.

There's a crazy percussion coming from the right speaker that I fell in love with. This has been a staple in the library for a while.

## Yussef Kamal - Mansur's Message [🔗](https://youtu.be/Dqk0LtYpKEg)
`indie jazz` `indie soul`

Okay so I'm cheating a bit, I played this song a lot more last week, but it's a very noteworthy mention - Took me right back to this [jam](https://youtu.be/NwVtIPeYIeQ) I found on Youtube a while ago. If anything, start with that track.

SGVO recently dropped an album, it's been lovely to experience the man level up his sound with each release.
