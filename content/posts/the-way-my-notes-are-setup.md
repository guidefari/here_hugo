summary: "A combination of Obsidian, Simplenote & Dropbox."

 ## main editor
 [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is the main markdown editor, for desktop. files are saved as plain old markdown on your localhost, which makes it easy to move notes around between services & devices.
 
 ## dropbox - sync
the Obsidian folder lives in my dropbox, which makes the notes available on the go. simple :)

## mobile & quick capture
Mobile editing is where it kinda sucks, they're accessible & editable within dropbox, but I can't download notes for offline use on a free dropbox account. So mobile editing is ideal for adding onto pre-existing notes, when I'm in a somewhat settled environment.

Quick capture on mobile is handled by [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). the notes are cloud synced, and it's usable when offline too, and the app launches like a rocket, which is ideal when I need to write down a million dollar idea before it disappears from my head.

I can then open Simplenote in the browser(desktop) & copy paste into the dropbox synced folder, using Obsidian, and simultaneously delete the file from Simplenote, keeping things tidy & single-source-of-truth friendly👌.

## plus side
The plus side to this more 'manual' system is it allows me to regularly review & interact with my quick capture notes, as a somewhat forgetful person, it helps keep some thoughts fresh in my mind.

# Update

I've since started using paid products from obsidian, namely [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) & [sync](https://obsidian.md/sync). that way I have all my notes in one place, even on the go(using [obsidian mobile](https://obsidian.md/mobile)), leaving dropbox as just a secondary backup.
