- [Setify](https://setify.co/) - doesn’t claim to be 100 percent perfect, but it’ll let you search concerts and gigs by artist, city, or date, then display the set list and convert it into a Spotify playlist. It’ll also inform you if it couldn’t find some songs – either because they were unknown covers or aren’t in the Spotify library.
- [Every Noise](http://everynoise.com/engenremap.html) - A glance into tracks from ALL genres on spotify.
- [Coverify](https://coverify.now.sh/#) - Your Spotify playlist deserves something better than a standard boring cover image.
